Financial Fraud Detection

This is financial fraud data about a bank and payments system. You will have to use this data to predict whether the transaction is Fraud or not ( isFraud column)

There are 6 million records in this dataset.
You can use first 4 million records for building the model, next 1 million records for evaluating the model and rest of the records as live records on which model would be evaluated in production.
Please create separate .py files for model training and prediction.
Make sure that your dataset during model building and prediction phase goes through same data processing and feature creation steps.

Your final deliverable can either be a python script which can be scheduled as a batch script or flask api endpoint which can be used to identify fraud transactions in real time.

Please submit the final report which gives a clear idea on the points below.
1)	ML model selected. 
2)	Features selected.
3)	Feature importance
4)	Evaluation of model
5)	Original code

Use the "fraud_detection" table from the Classification.db file for the project.
Please feel free to reach out to your mentor in case of any doubts.

 ## about the data dictionary 

 
step - maps a unit of time in the real world. 
In this case 1 step is 1 hour of time. Total steps 744 (30 days simulation).

type - CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT and TRANSFER.

amount - amount of the transaction in local currency.

nameOrig - customer who started the transaction

oldbalanceOrg - initial balance before the transaction

newbalanceOrig - new balance after the transaction

nameDest - customer who is the recipient of the transaction

oldbalanceDest - initial balance recipient before the transaction.

newbalanceDest - new balance recipient after the transaction.

isFraud - This is the transactions made by the fraudulent agents inside the simulation. 
In this specific dataset the fraudulent behavior of the agents aims to profit by taking 
control or customers accounts and try to empty the funds by transferring to another account
 and then cashing out of the system.

isFlaggedFraud - The business model aims to control massive transfers from one account 
to another and flags illegal attempts. An illegal attempt in this dataset is an attempt 
to transfer more than 200.000 in a single transaction.
